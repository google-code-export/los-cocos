1. I get a `Floating point exception` when running the examples/when writing an app.

This is caused by a bug in some versions of the nvidia OpenGL driver. Please upgrade your
driver. If you still get the problem, or have a non-nvidia video card, open an issue indicating your video card maker, model, chipset, and driver version.

2. I get an `Exception: No OpenAL device` when running the examples/when writing an app.

You need to have libopenal installed for pyglet apps to work. In Debian/Ubuntu systems, you can run `aptitude install libopenal0a` to fix this.
