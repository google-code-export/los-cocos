#summary Building the docs for cocos (and pyglet)

= Problems =

Trying to build the doc I found the problems

 * the doc builder was linux only (bash script riding python scripts)
 * epydoc problems with python 2.6
 * epydoc problems with docutils 0.6

= Solution =

Being close to release I don't want to shake the repo with lots of commit related to doc building, so I made a standalone package.

It is derived from the old toolchain by converting the bash script to python script, adjusting python scripts and patching the custom pyglet-epydoc for compatibility with python 2.6 and docutils 0.6 ( backward compat is retained)

The new script works in windows, and _should_ work in linux / mac, (testing needed, please report)

= Wanted =

 * Test runs in unix like systems ( non critical just now )
 * Test the html docs generated by me in windows( *critical* ) : they look ok in linux / mac ?

= Links =

google don't let me upload to the list archives at this time, uploaded to mediafire in the meantime

update: now google accepted the files, they show in the page
http://groups.google.com/group/cocos-discuss/files
but don't allow to download ATM. Maybe some time is needed to be effective.
W'll see.

update: zip downloads are disabled in googlegroups, see

http://groups.google.com/group/is-something-broken/browse_thread/thread/ee0bc4d6e3cd92da

In that thread a workaround is sugested: 
 * rename the files to txt, (done)
 * dowload like right-click in the name, save as (change the .txt to .zip)
 * I tested downloading the docs, it worked

update: 2010 07 06<br>
update: fix bad filename in this page

       * fixed href s when class=="reference apilink", thanks Ivo for bug report
       * re-uploaded only the docs, later will update code
       * txt trick applies 

 * doc builder toolkit, instructions in the readme: docgen_2010_06_30.zip
   (due to workaround you will see .txt)
   
 * latest html doc build : cocos_docs_2010_07_06.zip
   (due to the workaround you will see .txt)
