#summary Building the docs for cocos (and pyglet)

= Problems =

Trying to build the doc I found the problems

 * the doc builder was linux only (bash script riding python scripts)
 * epydoc problems with python 2.6
 * epydoc problems with docutils 0.6

= Solution =

Being close to release I don't want to shake the repo with lots of commit related to doc building, so I made a standalone package.

It is derived from the old toolchain by converting the bash script to python script, adjusting python scripts and patching the custom pyglet-epydoc for compatibility with python 2.6 and docutils 0.6 ( backward compat is retained)

The new script works in windows, and _should_ work in linux / mac, (testing needed, please report)

= Wanted =

 * Test runs in unix like systems ( non critical just now )
 * Test the html docs generated by me in windows( *critical* ) : they look ok in linux / mac ?

= Links =

You will find the docs and and doc builder in the download page for the project:

 http://code.google.com/p/los-cocos/downloads/list

 * doc builder toolkit, instructions in the readme: `docgen_*.zip`
   
 * latest html doc build : something with 'cocos' and 'doc' in the name, will be featured download

= Changelog =

    * 2010 07 10 : option --proof for faster render the cocos docs.
    * 2010 07 06 : href class="reference apilink"  now renders ok when gendoc_html runs in a window OS machine.
    * 2014 03 24 : for cocos release 0.6.0 the doc subsystem was changed to a sphinx based one, so the solution in this page is decommissioned.
