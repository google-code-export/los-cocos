Documentation Notes
===================

Making the switch to sphinx
===========================

Documentation was rendered with epydoc and some custom extensions until cocos 0.5.5. Epydoc is long time unmaintained, and needs patchs to work with newer python and docutils versions, so a change to a well maintained doc library was needed.

Sphinx is the current de facto standard, so documentation will use sphinx.

Guidelines for sphinx customization
===================================

Keep customization at a minimun to avoid the need of maintenace when sphinx changes.

Steps for initial sphinx support
================================

  * Using sphinx 1.2 release , docutils 0.11, pygments 1.5
  * deleting items in doc/ that sphinx won't use. (at that moment only doc/doc.css)
