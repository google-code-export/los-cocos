	. in Mac, theres no confirmed info. Should be similar to unix.


What explicit dependencies are declared in the setup.py ?
    six, ... ?
        

Compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compatibility notes at the time of writing, March 2014

    . python : cocos needs python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.3+
	  The cocos codebase has direct support for 2.x and 3.x, so no need to run 2to3  

    . pyglet : pyglet 1.2 or better
		. The last released pyglet is 1.1.4 from 2009, which does not
		  support python3, most 64bits OS, modern mac OS, etc
		  In pypi the last pyglet is 1.1.4,
		  in pyglet's googlecode downloads the last is an old 1.2alpha (2012)
		  It is recomended to use pyglet from repo at a revision near the tip.
		  ( ? insert revision under the cocos release was tested and example installations
		  with pip o checkout + setup.py install)
    

Installing from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

? rewrite this, probably with pip install sample

Install setuptools if you don't have it.( http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools )

Download cocos2d-0.5.0.zip, unzip to a temporary directory

In the command line do::

    cd <temporal_directory>
    python setup.py install
    (note that in windows the last line should be)
    setup.py install

Move from the temporary directory to your preferred locations the docs,
examples, tests and unitests

Done, you can delete the temporal directory.
All of cocos should be usable now, with the possible exceptions

    - cocos particles
    - SDL audio backend
    - AVBin (pyglet) audio-video backend 

If you need to add these, look at the dependencies and compatibility section.


Installing with easy_install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install setuptools if you don't have it.( http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools )

at the command line enter
    easy_install cocos
    
All of cocos should be usable now, with the possible exceptions

    - cocos particles
    - SDL audio backend
    - AVBin (pyglet) audio-video backend 

If you need to add these, look at the dependencies and compatibility section
    
You also will want to download the zip that contains the documentation, samples
and demo, and unzip to a convenient location.
