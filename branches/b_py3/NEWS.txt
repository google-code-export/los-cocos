New in cocos 0.6.0
==================

Python 3 supported
------------------
 
	. Support for python 2.4 and 2.5 was droped
	. We aim to support 2.6+ and 3.3+
	. It may work in 3.2 but that is untested and unsuported
	. The code directly supports 2.x and 3.x, no need for 2to3

Rendering order changed
-----------------------

The drawing order when visiting a node is from lesser z to greater z, and
for childs with same z the rule is 'draw in the order the childs were added'.

In cocos < 0.6.0 the intent was the same, but the second clause was not honored.

So, older code may need to use some explicit z or change the order the childs are added. 

Nodes support independent scaling in x and y direction
------------------------------------------------------

CocosNode retained the property scale for uniform scaling and gained
the properties scale_x , scale_y

scale_x * scale and scale_y * scale are the x and y scaling factors

See an example in test/test_scalexy.py
