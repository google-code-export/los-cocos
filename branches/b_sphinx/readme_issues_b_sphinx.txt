issues and remainders for the b_sphinx branch

#1 Better path for sphinx-build in doc\make.bat

The make.bat generated by sphinx-quickstart invokes sphinx-build by
if "%SPHINXBUILD%" == "" (
	set SPHINXBUILD=sphinx-build
)

It was changed to a hardcoded path invoke for convenience, before merging to trunk it should be: 
  restored to original
  make a note about using an unversioned mak.bat which sets SPHINXBUILD as a convenience for developing

#5 In individual module pages too much symbols in section Define.
Seen in all revisions , by example r1268

from mod import a, b, c -> a, b, c seen in defines
from mod import * -> all of symbols seen
import mod -> mod seen in defines (ex: math in cocos.euclid)

Some come from unnecesary 'from mod import *' (esp. mod==pyglet.gl), the real fix would be eliminate those star imports

Other star imports are probably more justified, like 'from base_actions import *' in cocos.actions subpackages

I was under the impresion that autodoc did respect the __all__ in the module (thus only including symbols in the all), but that is not the case here. Look at cocos.actions.camera_actions by example. Is something broken ? Some configuration must be set ? Some option is implicitly disabling that feature ?
Yes, http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/autodoc.html tells
"""
.. automodule:: noodle
   :members:

will document all module members (recursively)

For modules, __all__ will be respected when looking for members; the order of the members will also be the order in __all__.

#2 Get autodoc to work over cocos.particle and cocos.particle_system
Seen in r1257

The build crashed while trying to build cocos.particle and or cocos.particle_system.
The related error message was:
"""
Exception occurred:
  File "D:\hg_externals\pyglet_dev\pyglet\gl\lib.py", line 100, in errcheck
    raise GLException('No GL context; create a Window first')
GLException: No GL context; create a Window first
"""

1st thing to check: the machine running that build does not support GL point sprites, the crash reproduces in other machines ? - > no, a machine supporting point sprites gives same error.

Fixed at r1263, a cocos window created in conf.py before any autodoc atempt.
A bit of cleanup at r1264
closed

#3 warning.log "<autodoc>:0: WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string."

Disapeared as a side effect of other changes, noticed fixed at r1268 but the fix could have come from other intermediate revisions
