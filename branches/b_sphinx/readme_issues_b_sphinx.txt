#1 Better path for sphinx-build in doc\make.bat

The make.bat generated by sphinx-quickstart invokes sphinx-build by
if "%SPHINXBUILD%" == "" (
	set SPHINXBUILD=sphinx-build
)

It was changed to a hardcoded path invoke for convenience, before merging to trunk it should be: 
  restored to original
  make a note about using an unversioned mak.bat which sets SPHINXBUILD as a convenience for developing

#2 Get autodoc to work over cocos.particle and cocos.particle_system
Seen in r1257

The build crashed while trying to build cocos.particle and or cocos.particle_system.
The related error message was:
"""
Exception occurred:
  File "D:\hg_externals\pyglet_dev\pyglet\gl\lib.py", line 100, in errcheck
    raise GLException('No GL context; create a Window first')
GLException: No GL context; create a Window first
"""

1st thing to check: the machine running that build does not support GL point sprites, the crash reproduces in other machines ? - > no, a machine supporting point sprites gives same error.

Fixed at r1263, a cocos window created in conf.py before any autodoc atempt.
Probably pyglet should not see the epydoc flag, and cocos maybe should not see it until the window is created.   
Want to cleanup a bit, making is_epydoc -> is_cocos_sphinx

Mmmh, yes. That document is linked directly from doc\index.
The content is also reachable by the links 'Index' and 'Module index' in the home page.
Should I be worried about that ?

#5 The pages pointed by the links 'Index' and 'Module index' in the home page shows all entries under the letter 'C'
Maybe related to #4 ?
