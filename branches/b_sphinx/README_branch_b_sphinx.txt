The branch's purpose is to migrate the cocos documentation from epydoc to sphinx.

Goals and scope:

  A functional sphinx builder

  No code changes allowed in the package cocos except for docstrings

  Avoid heavy sphinx customization (hard to mantain, entry barrier
  for new people)  

  Branch should be closed fast
    Polishing should be done later

    When parts not rendering in sphinx are limited to non critical components,
    close the branch and open issues for trunk
